# Tourism-attractiveness-analysis

The objective of this study is to assess the tourism attractiveness of Poland’s regions using multivariate analysis methods, specifically linear ordering and cluster analysis.

The data is sourced from the Central Statistical Office of Poland (GUS). The analysis includes:

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and selection of relevant variables
- Ranking creation using linear ordering methods (including Helwig’s method and TOPSIS)
- Cluster analysis to group similar regions based on tourism characteristics
- Data visualization, including mapping the results onto Poland’s administrative regions
This study provides a data-driven approach to evaluating and comparing the tourism potential of Poland’s voivodeships.
